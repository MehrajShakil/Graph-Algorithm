It is defined as the longest path between any two node.

Naive approach :: 
We would run dfs , N times.

in each iteration we should set ith node as root and find distance of farthest node.
complexity O ( n^2 ).

Better approach ::

We can find diameter in only 2 DFS.

Take an arbitrary node as root and run dfs from it and find the farthest node , let this node be x.

Run a DFS from node x and find the maximum distance from this node to any other node, this distance is diameter.
