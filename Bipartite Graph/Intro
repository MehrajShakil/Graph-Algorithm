 Bipartite graph also known as Bigraph special graph such that you can divide the vertex set into two disjoint sets such that :
  1. Each vertex belongs to one of the two sets.
  2. Each edge connect vertices of two different sets.
  
  A = { 1 , 3 , 5 }
  B = { 2 , 4 , 6 }
  
  edges can be ::
  1 - 2
  1 - 4
  1 - 6
  3 - 2
  3 - 4
  3 - 6
  5 - 2
  5 - 4
  5 - 6
  
  but can not 
   1 - 3
   because 1 and 3 in set A.
   3 - 5
   3 and 5 in set A.
   2 - 6
   2 and 6 in set B.
